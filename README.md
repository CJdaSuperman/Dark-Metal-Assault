# Dark-Metal-Assault
This is the third game I ever made. Technically it's more of a tech demo, but this game was made with Unity Engine.

It's a unique tower defense game, where you have a limited number of towers in which you can place based upon your score. The higher your score, the more towers you can place. If you reached the max limit of towers you can place based upon your score, you can move those towers to other locations where needed.

I learned how to make this game through Udemy's Complete C# Unity Developer 3D course. Most of the assets were from the course. The codebase was initially from the course as well, however, I imporoved and refactored the codebase, as well as add more features than what the course offered. One of the features include a glowing indicator to show where you can and can't place a tower, or where your tower is going to be moved to.

To find the source code for this project, go to Assets-> Scripts. I also created a UML class diagram for the project to show how I visualized the scripts behaving with one another. The link provided is the progress made so far. https://youtu.be/wvEZ_VBreHU
